"""AI-Assisted Data Analysis Tool - Code Breakdown

This script is designed to analyze data from a CSV file by providing users with the ability to calculate basic statistics, generate histograms, compute correlations between columns, and detect outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Below is a breakdown of how the code is structured:

1. **Reading the CSV File**:
   - The function `read_csv(file_path)` is responsible for loading the CSV data into a `pandas` DataFrame.
   - We use `pd.read_csv(file_path)` for this operation, and the function handles any errors (e.g., file not found) gracefully using a try-except block.
   - The function returns the data as a DataFrame, which is then used for further analysis.

2. **Calculating Basic Statistics**:
   - The `calculate_stats(data, column)` function calculates the mean, median, mode, and standard deviation of the specified column using pandas' built-in functions: `.mean()`, `.median()`, `.mode()`, and `.std()`.
   - If the column does not exist in the data, the function returns an error message indicating that the column could not be found.
   - This part of the code helps summarize the column's distribution and central tendencies.

3. **Generating a Histogram**:
   - The `generate_histogram(data, column, bins)` function creates a text-based histogram.
   - The data for the specified column is divided into a given number of bins (default is 10), and the function counts how many values fall into each bin.
   - The histogram is represented as a series of hash (`#`) characters for each bin, visually indicating the frequency of values in that range.
   - The function calculates the min, max, and step size based on the number of bins and column data.

4. **Calculating Pearson Correlation**:
   - The `find_correlation(data, column1, column2)` function calculates the Pearson correlation between two columns using `pandas` `.corr()` method.
   - The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation).
   - This function checks if both columns exist in the dataset before performing the correlation computation.

5. **Detecting Outliers Using IQR**:
   - The `find_outliers(data, column, threshold)` function detects outliers based on the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
   - The function calculates the 1st quartile (Q1) and the 3rd quartile (Q3) and computes the IQR.
   - Outliers are defined as values below (Q1 - threshold * IQR) or above (Q3 + threshold * IQR). Any values falling outside these bounds are flagged as outliers and returned as a separate DataFrame.

6. **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**:
   - The `argparse` library is used to parse command-line arguments. It provides flexibility for the user to select the type of analysis to run (e.g., statistics, histogram, correlation, or outliers).
   - The user specifies the CSV file, the desired command, the target column(s), and optionally the number of bins for histograms and a threshold for detecting outliers.
   - Based on the user's input, the corresponding function is called, and the result is printed.

7. **Error Handling**:
   - Throughout the script, each function checks whether the specified columns exist in the dataset before proceeding. If a column is missing or if any errors occur, the user is provided with clear error messages."""
